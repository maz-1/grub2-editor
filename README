This is an unofficial kde frameworks 5 port of grub editor by Konstantinos Smanis
https://ksmanis.wordpress.com/category/grub2-editor/
For original README see the README.old file.

This port has some extra features compared to original grub2-editor:
    * All initialize jobs are merged into the same action, so password are only asked once on startup.
    * Add password protection setup(only tested on archlinux).
